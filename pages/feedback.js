            Flagging Letters
          </h2>
          <p>
            Let's be honest, some people suck. They puts words together that are unnecessarily
            hurtful or threatening. While this is meant to be an open platform for sharing thoughts,
            it's more important that it be a safe place.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you take issue with a particular letter, I would love to hear about it. Send me{" "}
            <a href="http://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=23583938" target="_blank">
              a message
            </a>{" "}
            or <a href="mailto:hello@seancdavis.com">email</a> with why you think the letter should
            be removed. Please include some identifiable details with the letter â€” the content,
            signature, or URL will do just fine.

              issues in GitHub

            If you are a GitHub user, it would be super duper awesome if you filed bugs directly on
